## Description

### Purpose

Miguelitto’s Pizzeria is a local food store that offers a varied menu of classic and popular pizza types and flavours, as well as its “Build your own pizza” service, where customers can create custom pizza flavour using any of the available bases, sauces and toppings.

As a food store, Miguelitto’s Pizzeria offers only take outs for orders, all of which need to be done in person, one by one through a queue. This is detrimental to the customer experience, as often times, especially on busy days, customers will need to wait both in queue to make their orders and while the order is getting done.

To go around this issue, the business has requested a webapp from which its customers can make complete orders online and have a time estimate of when it will be ready. This will make it so that customers don’t need to wait in line and may even make orders from the comfort of their homes, knowing exactly when they may go to the store to claim their order, providing a much better customer experience.
