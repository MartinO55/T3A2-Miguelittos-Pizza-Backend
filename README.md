## Description

### Purpose

Miguelitto’s Pizzeria is a local food store that offers a varied menu of classic and popular pizza types and flavours, as well as its “Build your own pizza” service, where customers can create custom pizza flavour using any of the available bases, sauces and toppings.

As a food store, Miguelitto’s Pizzeria offers only take outs for orders, all of which need to be done in person, one by one through a queue. This is detrimental to the customer experience, as often times, especially on busy days, customers will need to wait both in queue to make their orders and while the order is getting done.

To go around this issue, the business has requested a webapp from which its customers can make complete orders online and have a time estimate of when it will be ready. This will make it so that customers don’t need to wait in line and may even make orders from the comfort of their homes, knowing exactly when they may go to the store to claim their order, providing a much better customer experience.

### Functionality/Features

This app will include the functionality to allow users to order a standard pizza off a set menu, design their own pizza with a choice of different bases, sauce types, and toppings, offer the option to add sides and drinks and then return an estimate to the user as to how long it will take the order to be completed. The application will greet users with a landing page, offering them the option of visiting a menu of standard pizzas, which will offer the users the option of either selecting a prebuilt classic pizza (for example Napolitana), which can then be altered if desired and added to an order. Alternatively, Users will have the option of designing their own pizzas from the ground up with various choices of base type, sauce type and different toppings. The landing page will also lead to pages displaying social media and location information about Miguellito's pizzeria. Finally there will also be a login to allow access to the administarot dashboard for Miguelitto, showing the number of pizzas ordered and the order those pizzas were ordered in, and giving the user the option to mark the order as completed.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this app is the current customer base for Miguelitto’s pizzeria who are frustrated with the current system of taking orders that results in delays with both taking orders and preparing pizzas. In addition, this app will also positively affect Miguelitto’s, as they will be able focus on serving customer orders faster and more efficiently, thus increasing the number of orders they can fill and the amount of money the business can make.

Not all adventurous combinations will work together that well, and as such, Bob also wants to be able to select the sizes of any pizzas he creates, so that in case he creates a combination that turns out to be inedible he won’t end up wasting an entire full priced large pizza.

### Miguelitto

Miguellito is an overwhelmed business owner juggling both running the customer service side of his pizzeria and the kitchen side. Miguelitto needs an application that reduces the pressure on the customer service side of his business so that he can focus on creating pizzas and speeding up the cooking process. In addition, he also wants to offer customers more freedom to experiment with their own favourite toppings to create a better customer experience. Therefore the application needs to both give his customers the ability to order food directly, saving both his and his customers time. Miguelitto also needs an application that does not take a great amount of time and effort to learn so that the new system does not over-complicate his life, taking up more time to operate than it saves, so that he can concentrate on what he does best; making pizzas.
